# 1)First, you will need to install the "selenium" package in Python using pip.
# You can do this by opening the command prompt/terminal and running the following command:
# Code: pip install selenium

# pip install selenium schedule

# 2) Next, you need to download the appropriate version of the chromedriver executable that
# matches the version of Google Chrome you are using. You can download it from here:
# https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

# 3) Once you have downloaded the chromedriver executable, place it in a folder and note the
# path to the folder.
#
# Now, you can write the Python script. Here's an example script that will send a message to
# Skype using the Selenium library:

# import time
import schedule
import threading
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Replace with the URL of the X web app
x_url = 'https://x.com/'  # Update this with the correct URL if necessary

# Replace with the path to the chromedriver executable
chromedriver_path = 'path/to/chromedriver'  # Update this path

# Replace with your X username and message
x_username = 'Your X username'  # Update this with your X username
x_password = 'Your X password'  # Update this with your X password
message = 'Hello, world!'  # Your message to send

def send_x_message():
    # Open Chrome and navigate to X
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chromedriver_path)
    driver.get(x_url)

    # Wait for the page to load
    time.sleep(5)

    # Find the login button and click it (Update this selector as needed)
    login_button = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, "Log in")  # Adjust the selector as necessary
    login_button.click()

    # Wait for the page to load
    time.sleep(5)

    # Find the username field and enter your X username
    username_field = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'username')  # Update the selector as necessary
    username_field.send_keys(x_username)

    # Find the next button and click it (Update this selector as needed)
    next_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//span[text()="Next"]')
    next_button.click()

    # Wait for the password page to load
    time.sleep(5)

    # Find the password field and enter your X password
    password_field = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'password')  # Update the selector as necessary
    password_field.send_keys(x_password)

    # Find the login button and click it (Update this selector as needed)
    signin_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//span[text()="Log in"]')
    signin_button.click()

    # Wait for the page to load
    time.sleep(5)

    # Find the tweet input field and enter your message
    tweet_field = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//div[@role="textbox"][@contenteditable="true"]')
    tweet_field.send_keys(message)

    # Find the tweet button and click it (Update this selector as needed)
    tweet_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//div[@data-testid="tweetButtonInline"]')
    tweet_button.click()

    # Close the browser
    driver.quit()

# Schedule the message to be sent at 10:00 AM
schedule.every().day.at("10:00").do(send_x_message)

def run_scheduler():
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

# Start the scheduler in a separate thread
scheduler_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_scheduler)
scheduler_thread.start()
